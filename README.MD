# Status Scout

Status Scout is an automated job application tracking tool. It's designed to streamline the job search process by scanning your emails for application-related messages and organizing this information in a Google Sheet.

## What it does

- Searches your Gmail for job application emails
- Supports queries for Handshake and LinkedIn applications
- Allows custom keyword searches for other platforms
- Extracts relevant information like application dates and statuses
- Updates a Google Sheet with the collected data (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10H-ZVEZ7kCJeH1xGnBr5qTzHrJ2v8s0FVWy-RsasVGY/edit?usp=sharing)
- Provides options to download results as a database or text file

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python with Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (assumed, based on the structure)
- APIs: Google Gmail API, Google Sheets API

## Current Status

This project represents my first step towards full-stack development. As a learning exercise, it combines backend logic, API integration, and a basic web interface.

## Areas for Improvement

1. Frontend Development: The current HTML structure suggests a basic frontend. I plan to enhance this with JavaScript for a more dynamic user experience and improve the styling with CSS.

2. Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling and user feedback.

3. Security: Improve the handling of API credentials and user data.

4. Testing: Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability.

5. Code Organization: Refactor the code for better modularity and maintainability.

6. Documentation: Expand this README with setup instructions and usage examples.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I plan to update this project with:

- A more sophisticated frontend, possibly using a framework like React
- Enhanced data visualization of job application statistics
- User authentication to support multiple users
- Expanded platform support for job application tracking
- Deployment to a cloud platform for wider accessibility

This project is a work in progress, and I'm excited to evolve it as I expand my skills in full-stack development!
